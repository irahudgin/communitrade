Communitrade is a desktop software application that will be created to connect users with each other so that they may offer items for trade with other users in lieu of using any currency. Rather than using money to buy goods, this platform will only allow clients to accept offers to exchange for other items. The trade management system will connect users' devices to the internet to update our database, and refresh their selection of items to browse and trade. Users will be able to create postings, and make offers on items that are listed in the application. The application will be available for computers running the windows operating system. The system will be built upon the c# language and the .NET framework
